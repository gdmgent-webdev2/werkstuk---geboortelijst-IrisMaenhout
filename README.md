# Babylist

For this project I made a website where parents can put together a wish list for their baby, parents and friends can view this and buy the necessary items. It is important that if you want to set up the project locally that you first seed the database by the following command: php artisan db:seed. This is necessary to import the administrator data contained in the .env file into the database.

Website: [http://www.babylist.site/](https://www.babylist.site/)

## create and/or update baby list
Parents can create a list and personalize it by entering the child's name, uploading an image and sending a message for all the people who will view this list in the future.

## shop
After that, one can proceed to the store where various items have been pulled in from https://juneandjulian.com/. I also wanted to import articles from babywinkel.be and babylux.be but this didn't work so it only works for juneandjulian.com.

The products can be added to the baby list and can also be bought later by friends or family.
The added products can also be displayed in the overview of the baby list.

## overview baby list
Here parents can see all added products, but they can also see which products have already been ordered. If you want to change the information of their baby list, you can do so by clicking on the pencil. They also have the option to share the baby list via email, this way the url and password of their list are shared.

Friends and family can purchase products but cannot add products to the list or share the list with others.
